### *Name of company:* 
OptionAlpha

### *When was the company incorporated?*
2010

### *Who are the founders of the company?* 
Founders: Kirk Du Plessis and Jack Slocum. 
Current CEO: Kirk Du Plessis. 

### *How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?* 
+ Kirk Du Plessis mentioned during one of his podcast episodes that he had the idea years ago.
He mentioned that it was the most logic next step based on how everything was changing. Most large hedge funds use bots to execute trades and they have found
the bots perform better than humans because of the lack of emotions. As we know, when humans allow the planning steps of a bot to take control instead of their intuition, the bot outperform. As humans we use our emotions which end up hurting ourselves in the long-term. 
+ The automated bots were created to help humans use the practices and force them to just remove emotions. 
+ The users can select bots based on their investment preferences and it provides performance statistics. Moreover, OptionAlpha allows users to edit the bots to their investment preferences. 


### *How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?* 
- During the platform upgrade, they sold lifetime access to the platform for a certain amount. From my recollection, it was about 4,000. 
Kirk said this was used to fund the development of the platform and run test of all the bots. Those that did not purchase a lifetime access, current pay a monthly fee.

## Business Activities

### *What specific problem is the company or project trying to solve?*
- OptionAlpha is a Market Research, Podcast, and a self-managed automated bot platform. 
- They are trying to solve the issue of investors using their emotions to make investments. 
- OptionAlpha provides bots based on a user investment style and it is linked to the brokerage. 
-It then takes the planned action and performs them if the expected events occur. No actions are taken if the expect event detailed in the bot’s criteria does not happen. Based on the bot’s criteria, it will manage it on its own without any human involvement. 


> For example, a user can use a covered call bot that sells covered calls on their shares. Lets say a user owns 100 shares of APPL and creates a bot without code to sell a covered call that is a certain percetage away from the current price.
> > > The bot can be designed to perform these actions based on the criteria given and stay with the covered call until the expiration or close until you have 75% of the expected profit. 
> > > Then it starts all over again. This process continues without any human involvement. 
> > > > Meaning the user can earn money from the growth of their stock plus extra from the coveredcalls.
> > > > > Essentially, they are to removing ~~human emotions~~ when making investment decisions. 

### *Who is the company's intended customer? Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?*
- The intended customers are any person who makes investments via stocks and want to automate the process for a long period of time without frequently looking at their account.
- Although automated trading is not new, the people with access to these services has only been heavily funded hedge funds.  
- OptionAlpha now delivers this service to the average individual. 
- Unlike humans, automated bots don't sleep and can take care of your account. While human will conpensate, or are overly optimistic or pesimistic. 


### *What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)*
 
- Brokerages such as TastyTrade, TradeStation, TD-Ameritrade, Charles Schwab, and Robinhood provide free trading or with minimal fees. Users can place pre-determined orders on a specific stock price. However, they do not have a automated bot trading product. I was not able to find another automated bot trading service. 
- Plus, when individual places orders it is not on a specific strategy. On the other hand, the bots are specifically designed based on a strategy and contains as many if statement criteria as you would like to include. 


### *Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing&mdash;you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)*

## Landscape

### *What field is the company in?*
OptionAlpha is in the automated trading field.

### *What have been the major trends and innovations of this field over the last 5&ndash;10 years?* 
- The average individual has more access to data in order to build their own bots. 

### *What are the other major companies in this field?*
- I was not able to find other companies that do this work. 

## Results

### *What has been the business impact of this company so far?*

- OptionAlpha is a very new start-up. Since their launch, they have slowly started to partner with most brokerages allowing their users to quickly link their accounts to their OptionAlpha platform. 
- They have taught many beginner investors how to trade without emotions and letting the automated bots just take over with requiring attention. 
- According to their website, it has saved users money on fees and taught users many different strategies.
  

## *What are some of the core metrics that companies in this field use to measure success? How is your company performing based on these metrics?*
- New of users and Total users
- Podcast listening 
- Automated Bot Performance 

## *How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same field?*
- Although I did not find other companies conducting bot automation, I don't think OptionAlpha is taking advantage of the monopoly. They don't advertise as much as they should. Their primary way of advertising is via their podcast and via social media. 
Their product is great and they teach users how to use successful strategies based on bot testing and performance, however, their strategy to increase their audience is poor. 
- Their CEO, Kirk is very shy. At the moment, individuals are getting used to having a loud active CEO. For example, companies like Tesla with Elon Musk and Nvidia with Jensen Huang which use social media to attract their audience and make people aware of their companies work.


## Recommendations

### *If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)*
1. Improve Social Media presense and create more ads to increase brand awareness. 
2. Create a machine learning service that learns from your investment, and create suggestions based on your previous behaviors. Lastly, also suggest of similar bots that you would like based on the previous bot you used. 
3. Create a service that sends a written summary based on Daily/Weekly/Monthly outcomes. For example, it can look at the performance of your account and the bots you have used, and write a summary based on account key metrics. 

### *Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?*
1. I think these offering would help users learn about themselves and would have them come back to the platform. 

### *What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?*
1. The can also use Financial APIs to create  on time Market Research and have a Large Language Model write a summary of the imcoming data. 

### *Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?*
1. This is appropriate because it would take the platform to the next level with minimal effort.
